# Metropolia Web Development – Course Tasks

This repository contains my weekly assignments and practice tasks for the **Metropolia Web Development course**.

## ⚠️ Important Note

Originally, I had all my assignments for **Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3** stored in a different repository.  
Unfortunately, due to a Git/GitHub issue, that repository became inconsistent and some of my work was accidentally removed.

To avoid further problems and to keep everything clean and organized, I decided to create a **new repository** and re-upload my completed assignments here.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The assignments are organized by week:

- `week1/` – Week 1 tasks and exercises  
- `week2/` – Week 2 tasks and exercises  + pair programing activity 1 nad 2
- `week3/` – Week 3 tasks and exercises  

Each folder may contain multiple sub-projects (labs, exercises, React apps, etc.).

## 🛠️ Notes

- `node_modules` folders are intentionally excluded from this repository.
- To run any project locally:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
